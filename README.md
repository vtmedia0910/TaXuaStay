# TÀ XÙA STAY

**Đúng phòng. Đúng view. Yên tâm lên Tà Xùa.**

This repository contains the independent Tà Xùa Stay application. Phase 1 adds the dedicated Stay database foundation, `admin`/`staff` authorization, row-level security, and public-safe site settings. Accommodation inventory, pricing, availability, and booking domains have not been created yet.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to a local `.env.local` only when a dedicated Stay Supabase project is available. Never use Tà Xùa Biker credentials.

Apply the Phase 1 migration only to the dedicated Stay project before using Admin settings:

```text
supabase/migrations/202608290001_stay_foundation.sql
```

The public page remains usable with safe local defaults when Supabase environment variables are absent or settings cannot be read.

## Quality gates

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```
